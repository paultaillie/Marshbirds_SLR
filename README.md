### Project Overview and Script Format
This directory includes all the required data and code to format raw data, fit 
models, summarize results, and produce figures.

The files are grouped in an R
project and thus are relatively linked.  This means the user does not have to 
set working directory to get scripts to run.  Simply unzip the folder, open R,
open the project file with the same name as that found at the top of this 
document.  Required packages may have to be installed.
